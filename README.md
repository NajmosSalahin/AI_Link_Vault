üõ†Ô∏è AI Integration

LinkVault utilizes the **Gemini API** for its advanced AI features. The `callGeminiAPI` function handles requests to the `gemini-2.0-flash` model for various tasks:

* `generateDetailsWithGemini()`: Fetches a summary, title, and tags for a given URL.
* `smartSearchWithGemini()`: Identifies relevant bookmarks from your collection based on a user query.
* `summarizeCollectionWithGemini()`: Provides a high-level summary of your entire bookmark collection.
* `askAboutLinkWithGemini()`: Answers questions about the content of a specific linked website.
* `findSitesWithGemini()`: Recommends websites based on a user's prompt, categorizing them by type (Paid, Free, Open Source).

**Note**: The API key for Gemini is handled internally by the Canvas environment and is not exposed in the code.
